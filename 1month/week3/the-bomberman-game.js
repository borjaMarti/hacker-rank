// The Bomberman Game

// Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid. Each cell in the grid either contains
// a bomb or nothing at all.

// Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but once planted, it will
// detonate after exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€”
// along with anything in its four neighboring cells. This means that if a bomb
// detonates in cell i, j, any valid cells (i +- 1,j) and (i,j +- 1) are
// cleared. If there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the neighboring bomb is
// destroyed without detonating, so there's no chain reaction.

// Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid.
// Here's what he does:

//     1. Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells,
//        the initial state.
//     2. After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
//     3. After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without
//        bombs, thus filling the whole grid with bombs. No bombs detonate at
//        this point.
//     4. After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago
//        will detonate. Here, Bomberman stands back and observes.
//     5. Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.

// Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs are planted
// simultaneously (i.e., at the exact same moment), and any bombs planted at the
// same time will detonate at the same time.

// Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's
// first batch of planted bombs, determine the state of the grid after N
// seconds.
