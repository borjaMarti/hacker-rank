# XOR Strings

# Given two strings consisting of digits 0 and 1 only, find the XOR of the two
# strings.

# Debug the given function strings_xor to find the XOR of the two given strings
# appropriately.

# NOTE FROM ME: The challenge wasn't doable (the code was missing) in
# JavaScript, so I switched toÂ Python 3 to solve it.

        else:
            res += '1'; # Originally res = '1';
