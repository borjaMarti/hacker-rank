# Codewars Repository

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges that I practice daily to strengthen my JavaScript skills.

## Lessons Learned:

In each challenge, I like to include other user's solutions that I found clever or well-optimized, to learn new ways I can improve my implementation or new methods I wasn't familiar with and could be useful in the future.

Other than the algorithms and methods specific to each kata, there are also two main takeaways for me:

#### · There is (_almost_) always some way to improve:

Although sometimes a naive implementation is enough, searching for other people's code or learning about the type of problem we are trying to solve can help us write better code and better solutions.

#### · Styling matters:

It is difficult to understand someone else's code when they haven't put thought into the structure or variable names. I try to make my solutions as readable as possible by using relevant names and maintaining visual clearness.
